# Render-Engine

A basic OpenGL-based 3D rendering engine built with LWJGL as an OpenGL port for Java. It's able to render and manipulate basic geometry in 3D space with a number of different textures.
- Contains a custom rendering system through the programable pipeline in OpenGL 4.1 
- Uses the JOML libraries for better matrix implementation
- Uses a custom image loader utilizing the STB library.
